This waveform shows the simulation of 2 architectures of our accumulator, one structural and one behavioural.

A_i and B_i are the input numbers for the accumulator.
Y_s and Y_b are the outputs of the structural and behavioural accumutaors respectively.
RST_n_i resets the value of the accumulator when 0, which also puts the output at 0.
ACC_EN_n_i lets the accumulator update it's output when 0, and fixes at the last value when 1.
ACCUMULATE_i decides if the second input of the accumulator comes from B_i or the previously accumulated value.

We start the simulation by reseting both components. Since reset is synchronous, the outputs first start with an unknown value then change to 0 even though the input is not 0.

At clock cycle 2, we release the reset add A with the accumulated value (1 + 0 = 1).

At clock cycle 3, we add A with B, replacing the accumulated value (1 + 2 = 3).

At clock cycles 4, 5 and 6 we keep accumulating the stored value with 16.

At clock cycle 7 we set the output to a new value (272) then at clock cycle 8 we disable the accumulator and we can see that the value does not accumulate as expected, but instead remais at the previous value.

Both architectures show the same behavior during simulation, as expected.
